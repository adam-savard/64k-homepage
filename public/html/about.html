  </h1>

    So you want to make yourself a homepage? Neat. Let's talk about some of the limitations:
    <br><br>
    <ul style="border: 2px solid black; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Webpage must be 4k or less</li>
        <li>No JavaScript (script tags are parsed out)</li>
        <li>Images must be hosted off-site</li>
        <li>A single html file can be submitted</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>

    And here are some guidelines (optional):
    <ul style="border: 2px solid black; list-style-position: inside;">
        <li>Retro-friendly means 640x480 or less</li>
        <li>Images should not be massive and should be 256 colors or less</li>
        <li>Limited CSS; remember that older machines can't handle HTML5</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br>
    Doesn't seem too limiting, does it? This is all in an effort to present information as consicely and fast as possible. The goal for the whole page is to be retro-friendly,
    so that an 8088 could view the page.
    <br><br>
    As for content, you can put whatever you like, though the idea is to create homepages to share with others; think of it like a landing page that describes a topic, yourself, etc.
